        <p className='text-xl mt-4 mb-5'>
          Biorhythms, a concept stemming from the 19th century, 
          explore the idea that human lives are influenced by regular cycles in emotional, physical, and intellectual capacities.
        </p>
        <p className='text-xl mt-4 mb-5'>
          The term merges two Greek words: bios (life) and rhythmos (steady flow). Biorhythm theory posits that understanding these cycles
          can help predict day-to-day abilities by analuzing sinusoidal waves that start at birth. It suggests that our capacity in these domains is
          influenced by natural, rhythmic biological cycles, potentially linked to biofeedback mechanisms like hormone secretion patterns.

        <p className='text-xl mt-4 mb-5'>
          The Biorhythm model use three  cycles: a 23-day physical cycle (Circavigintan), a 28-day emotional cycle, and a 33-day intellectual
          cycle (Circavigintan). Each of these cycles varies between high and low extremes sinusoidally, with days where the cycle crosses the 
          zero line describe as critical days of greater risk or uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p className='text-xl mt-4 mb-5'>
          Theories state the equations for the cycles as following
        </p>
        <ul className="text-lg ml-8 font-bold">
          <li>.physical sin(2Πt/23)</li>
          <li>.emotional sin(2Πt/28)</li>
          <li>.intellectual sin(2Πt/33)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className='text-xl mt-4 mb-5'>
          Using the formula where t represents days since birth, the interplay of 23-day physical, 28-day emotional, and 33-day intellectual cycles suggests a 
          fascinating rhythm to human abillites and behaviors. These cycles, aligning every 21,252 days (approximately 58.2 years), underscore a deep-rooted periodicity in human existence,
          influencing our day-to-day potential and well- beging.
